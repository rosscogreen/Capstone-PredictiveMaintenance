## Capstone Project

## Predictive Maintenance
This project explores a predictive maintenance solution on a simulated engine dataset. By monitoring time series operational data about an asset, patterns in the degradation of the asset over its lifetime can be found. A machine learning approach is used to find these patterns and use them to predict failure conditions of an in-service asset in order to inform actionable outcomes to optimise maintenance and use of the asset to achieve business goals.
